## Expense Tracker

Create an expense tracker application that allows users to track their expenses and income.

Users should be able to add new transactions, categorize them, and view their overall financial summary.
You can also add features like filtering transactions by date, category, or type (expense/income), 
and generating reports or visualizations of the user's spending habits.
